### Code Explanation

Visualization.py
For the visualization of the model perfomance on an single random selected image


### Key Components

#### 2. **Utility Functions**

**`countImages(image)`**:
- Counts the number of pages (images) in a multi-page TIFF.
- Iteratively calls `image.seek()` until an `EOFError` occurs.
- Outputs the total count of images.

**`displayImages(image, title)`**:
- Displays all pages of a multi-page TIFF in a grid layout.
- Utilizes `plt.subplot` for organizing the images.

**`predict_single(image, model)`**:
- Passes a single image through the model for prediction.
- The image is unsqueezed to add a batch dimension and moved to the appropriate device (CPU/GPU).

**`evaluate_test(prediction, expected)`**:
- A test function that crops both the predicted and expected tensors to the same size and compares them.
- Returns binary masks of the prediction and ground truth as well as a difference mask.
- only used to test the visualization

**`evaluate(prediction, expected)`**:
- The main evaluation function.
- Converts predictions to binary masks and crops them to match the ground truth.
- Computes a difference mask to visualize discrepancies.

#### 3. **Model Setup**
- The script selects the computation device (`cuda` or `cpu`).
- Model loading code is commented out, model still has to be trained and loaded.

#### 4. **Dataset Loading and Visualization**

**Training and Test Data**:
- Loads training and test datasets (images and labels) from multi-page TIFF files.
- The `displayImages()` function is used for visualizing the datasets.

#### 5. **Prediction and Visualization**

**Random Image Selection**:
- A random image ID is selected from the test dataset using `random.randint`.
- The selected image and its corresponding label are processed.

**Tensor Transformation**:
- Both the test image and label are transformed into tensors using `torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()`.

**Visualization of Predictions**:
- Predictions are evaluated using the `evaluate()` function, which returns masks for the prediction, ground truth, and their differences.
- These masks are visualized using `plt.imshow()` with colorbars and titles.

### Workflow
1. **Counting and Displaying Images**:
   - Use `countImages` and `displayImages` to inspect the dataset.

2. **Tensor Preparation**:
   - Convert images and labels to tensors and ensure appropriate dimensions for the model.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Run the pre-trained U-Net model on the test image to generate predictions.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Crop predictions and ground truth masks to the same size.
   - Compute and visualize discrepancies.

### Notes
- **Data Cropping**: The U-Net model outputs smaller predictions (388x388) compared to input images (512x512) due to the network architecture. Cropping ensures alignment with ground truth.
- **Device Compatibility**: The script dynamically selects `cuda` if available, improving computational efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive visualization helps in diagnosing model performance, particularly through the difference mask.
- **Incomplete Model Integration**: The model is not explicitly loaded or used in this script; placeholder code exists for integration.

### Output Structure
- **Test Image**: The input image from the test set.
- **Prediction**: The predicted segmentation mask.
- **Ground Truth**: The actual segmentation mask.
- **Difference**: Discrepancies between the prediction and ground truth.
